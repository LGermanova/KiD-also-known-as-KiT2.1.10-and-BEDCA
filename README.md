# KiD-also-known-as-KiT2.1.10-and-BEDCA
Subcellular Euclidean distance measurements with Multicolor Fluorescence localization imaging
The KiD software allows users to perform data quality control for gaussian-shaped spots with good signal-to-noise ratio, and then to measure the 3D Delta Euclidian distances between kinetochore components in fixed cells. The user can also measure Delta between kinetochore components at kinetochore marker "positive" and "negative" kinetochores, as defined by eye.
The BEDCA software corrects the inflation in the 3D Delta Euclidian distance measurements done in KiD.
For full details on software functionality and use see Germanova, et al.,STAR Protocols, 2021 and Roscioli, et al., Cell Reports, 2020.
