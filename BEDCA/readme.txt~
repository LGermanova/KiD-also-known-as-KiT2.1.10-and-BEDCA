This is for Euclidean distance correction of 3D spinning disc microscope

Use the driver (now a function, see MasterRunExpts with some calling examples)

EuclDistCorrection_Driver_fn (add new experiments in ExptData_List)

MCMC runs are saved in
MCMCruns

You can load an mcmcrun with

load_mcmc_runs (unpackmcmcdat can be useful)

To generate statistics (automatic with MCMC run) use
create_outputs

Figures are:
Figures Posteriors for mu, sdx, sdz
MCMC_EuclDistMargFigs Posteriors of MC variables
MCMC_EuclDistMargFigsConv  Convergence plots
