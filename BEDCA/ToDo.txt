ReRunEuclDist  to load MCMC run, find last point and rerun. Use a run id for all chains. Include in Master

LoadDist -> lower case
% typ='columns' loads a column file of 3D distances in form [Delta3D theta]. TO DO
Models: 2 mu, disc (uniform points).
Hierarchical model after kruskalWallis test

Redo simulations with MCMC outrput.

save MCMC traces
Look at tau priors? Bias? DMSO? Simulation noisy? 
multiple treatments
Bub1 zero? prior strength? Possibly due to z filterdist too large.

Compare output to filtered data. Inflation correction rel to filtered. DONE. Change hist to use sam e boxes
Tab output. Done.


Marginal alg  works.
Try on data with z zeroed. (chromatic aberration correction bias?).
Try on z-filtered data?
Add convergence diag. Multi-chain.
Check correlations taux-mu Sometimes negative????
New algorithm with mu=0 for dual CENPA.



*************************

On the expt data (iM_161122_161206_170130_170213_170309_9G3C_dmso_sel) strong tau priors
a=100;
params.mu=80;
params.sig=[25 75]; % Rough values
algparams.priors.params={[70 10000],[a params.sig(1)^2*a],[a params.sig(2)^2*a]}; % 10% error priors 

we get convergence to mu ~ 90 for suitable starting mu = 10-1000, sigx,sigz at their means.

but mu ~ 0 for initialisation from priors- phi uniform.
Write a prior for phi defined by taux.

Suggests convergence problem.
1. 
2. Hamiltonian MCMC, or simulated annealing?

Is there a bias?
Try simulation with theta distribution as expt. Does this have mu -> 0 problem?
What is mu bias.
